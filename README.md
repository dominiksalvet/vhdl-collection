# VHDL Utilities

Handy generic VHDL utilites that can be used as part of a VHDL project. Every VHDL module has been simulated and works as intended. Test bench files of the simulation are also included in a module's appropriate directory. A project file is also published with set up all the VHDL modules using and so it can be tested before real use.

## Documentation

The VHDL code is documented using comment header and inline comments.

## License

Unless otherwise stated, the VHDL modules are licensed under the MIT license, see the [`LICENSE.txt`](LICENSE.txt) file for details. The license or a notice about license for a specific module must be found at the bottom of the file where it is the module defined.
