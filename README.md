# VHDL Collection

Handy generic VHDL modules that can be used as part of a VHDL project. Every VHDL module has been simulated and works as intended. Test bench files of the simulation are also included in a module's appropriate directory. A project file is also published with set up all the VHDL modules using and so they can be tested before real use in this prepared sandbox.

## List of available modules
* [Clock Divider](clk_divider)
* [First In, First Out](fifo)
* [Last In, First Out](lifo)
* [Memory Copier](mem_copier)
* [Parallel In, Serial Out](piso)
* [Pulse-Width Modulation](pwm)
* [Random-Access Memory](ram)
* [Read-Only Memory](rom)
* [Seven-Segment Display Driver](seg7_driver)
* [Serial In, Parallel Out](sipo)
* [Static Clock Divider](static_clk_divider)

## Documentation

The modules are documented inside it's VHDL source files using comment headers and inline comments.
